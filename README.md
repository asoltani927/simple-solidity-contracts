## Overview
The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to build, deploy, and test basic smart contracts using Solidity, Hardhat, and Viem. The repository is set up to work with:
- **Solidity**: The smart contract language.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Viem**: A modern alternative to Ethers.js for interacting with Ethereum, emphasizing type safety.
- **TypeScript**: For writing and running type-safe tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running or contributing to this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

Additionally, you'll need:
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum.
- **Viem**: To interact with smart contracts in a type-safe way.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-solidity-contracts.git
   cd simple-solidity-contracts
